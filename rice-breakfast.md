# Cheese naans

This is what I eat most mornings and whenever I'm hungry during the day.
These quantities usually last approximately a week.

## Ingredients

| Item             | Quantity | Comments                                   |
|------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| brown round rice | 500gr    | it needs to be "round" rice                |
| cinnamon         | a pinch  | as you like it                             |
| cream cheese     | 300gr    |                                            |
| honey            | 3 tbsps  | more or less as you like it                |
| vanilla pod      | 1/4      | vanilla extract works too                  |
| walnuts          | 10Â±2     | or hazelnuts, probably other nuts work too |

## Process

- Wash thoroughly your rice, even more so if brown
- Cook it adding cinnamon to the water (if you have a rice cooker it's even better)
- Put the rice in a big baking dish
- Add the honey, the vanilla and the cream cheese
- Mix it so it is thoroughly homogeneous
- Make sure everything is cold before adding the nuts, otherwise they'll lose crunchiness
- Mix again
- Put a lid on the dish or foil
- Let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before starting to eat it
