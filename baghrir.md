## Process

- Mix everything but the baker's yeast and baking powder, use a food mill or blender if available
- Add the baker's yeast and baking powder
- Mix everything again
- Small bubbles should be appearing
- Put everything through a thin sieve
- Let the dough rest for 15-30 mins
- Put a very thin layer of oil in a fry pan and heat it
- Once hot, spread a small layer of dough in the pan as if making a pancake
- A "thousand" holes should appear, cook only on one side
- If cooking a batch, don't stack them on top of each other after cooking. Rather, let them rest
separately on a cloth.

For spreads, there are multiple options:
- salty, with a thin layer of olive oil for example
- sweet:
  - butter and honey
  - sugar syrup with orange blossom and cinnamon
  - maple syrup
  - jam
  - etc
