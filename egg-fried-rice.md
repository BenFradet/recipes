## Process

- separate the rice grains as much as you can
- warm up some oil on high heat in a frying pan or wok if you have it
- break and whisk the eggs
- once hot, add the eggs
- break them apart in thin strips
- once they start to brown, add the rice
- add more oil
- the rice needs to be shiny, not dull
- always keep the rice moving, with the heat, the oil and the friction, the grains will finish separating themselves
- get off the heat once the rice looks homogeneous
- add the soy sauce, put back on the heat
- mix continuously until the colour is homogeneous
- get off the heat
- add the miso, put back on the heat
- mix continuously until the colour is homogeneous
- stop the heat
- add the peas and green onions
- mix to spread the heat around
