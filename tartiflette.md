# Tartiflette

Discalimer: this is not the real tartiflette recipe as it does not contain lardons (small pieces of
bacon).

The quantities used here serve around 10 people.

## Ingredients

| Item             | Quantity | Comments                        |
|------------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| potatoes         | 2kg      | a firm flesh variety, e.g.      |
| onions           | 1kg      |                                 |
| reblochon cheese | 750gr    |                                 |
| garlic cloves    | 3/4      | to your taste                   |
| olive oil        | some     |                                 |

## Process

- Dice the onions into thin pieces
- Dice all the garlic cloves but one into even thinner pieces
- Brush and wash the potatoes (but do not peel them)
- Cut them into small cubes
- Rince them and drain them in a sieve
- Find a baking dish which can go in the oven
- Rub thoroughly the interior of your dish with a garlic clove
- Put some olive oil in a properly-sized fry pan
- Once the pan is hot, add the onions and garlic (do not cover the pan)
- Start the oven for 200C in rotating heat mode if you have it
- Once the onions are golden-coloured, decrease the fire and put a lid on the pan (add water if
needed)
- Once they are translucent, add the potatoes and increase the fire
- Roast the potatoes on each side, they do not need to be cooked thoroughly
- Remove from the fire
- Cut the reblochons as to have two smaller cylinders with one side of crust and another of cheese
- Depending on the height of the baking dish, put alternating layers of potatoes and cheese halves
with the crust facing towards the top of the baking dish. The top layer should always be cheese.
- Put the baking dish in the oven once it has reached 200C
- Leave for around 20 minutes or when the cheese is properly coloured but not burned

Enjoy while it's hot!
