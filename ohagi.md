## Process

- at least 36 hours before: soak the beans in water with baking soda and store in the fridge
- once soaked, rinse the beans
- put the beans in your rice cooker with 350ml of water, the salt and the sugar
- cook the beans with the "thinner congee" setting in the rice cooker
- once cooked, check the consistency of the beans: they should collapse under the pinching force of
your fingers
- mix the beans well until homogeneous
- wash the rice
- drain the rice for 30 minutes plus
- cook the rice with the "sweet rice" setting
- once cooked, mash the rice a small amount
- spread the rice on a flat surface
- cut the spread into 6 pieces of equal amount
- spread a bit of plastic wrap over a small bowl
- put one of the six rice bits on top of the plastic wrap
- put a table spoon of beans puree on top of the rice
- shape a ball with the plastic wrap with the rice forming the outer shell
- remove the plastic wrap, place the self-standing ball of rice on a serving platter
- repeat for the other pieces
- eat while still hot
