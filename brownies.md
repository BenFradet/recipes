## Process

- Sift through the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder and chicory
- Whisk the sugar, oil, butter, vanilla extract and eggs
- Add the latter into the former
- Mix with a spatula
- Add the walnuts or whatever you like
- Pour into a rectangular pan and spread evenly
- Put into a pre-heated oven at 180Â° for about 20-25 minutes
- Prefer a material with high thermal conductivity (e.g. prefer stainless steel over glass) so that
the brownies stop cooking once taken out
