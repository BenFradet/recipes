## Process

- Mix the flour together with the baking powder and the salt in a big bowl
- Add the olive oil one tbsp at a time, mix well
- Mix the honey together with the yogurt
- Add the yogurt together with the honey to the preparation, make everything homogeneous
- Incorporate some water tablespoon by tablespoon until the dough is flexible but not too sticky.
Add flour to counterbalance the water if there is too much water and vice versa.
- When satisfied with the dough, work it a bit on a floured kitchen worktop
- Place it back in the bowl, add very little olive oil on the dough
- Place a wet cloth on top of the bowl
- Leave the bowl together with the cloth in the sun for at least 2hrs
- Cut the dough into 6 pieces of ~equal weight
- Make round balls with each of them
- Roll each of them until ~1mm thick on a floured kitchen worktop
- Spread cream cheese on half of the roll
- Fold the roll in two
- Seal it shut with your fingers first and a rolling pin next, gently
- Warm a fry pan with the cover with the stove on high
- Once warm place a naan inside, close the lid
- Once the naan is properly inflated, turn it over
- If using a gas stove, finish "blazing" it directly with the flame

Enjoy while it's hot!
